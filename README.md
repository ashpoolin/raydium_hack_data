# raydium_hack_data (~2022-12-16)
- Currently focused on the wallets that funded the exploit
- Not a comprehensive list of all addresses related to the hack/exploit
- Will contain errors, use at your own risk
- Notably lacking on data/analysis actual exploit wallet itself (AgJddDJLt17nHyXDCpyGELxwsZZQPqfUsuwzoiqVGJwD)
- Wallet addresses and transaction contained in this data set is not an allegation of wrongdoing
- Files with different sha256 hashes than the ones I have here are modified, I cannot guarantee that work
- I offer absolutely no guarantees on this work
